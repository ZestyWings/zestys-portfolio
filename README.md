## My Portfolio Assignment

My motivation is to build a Portfolio that I can put all my future projects in 

This assignment really challenged my knowledge on CSS and how to put ideas I envision in my head to the actual screen

What I learned through doing this is it doesn't take one singular way to achieve the same results.

I don't think this project will stand out as of now but I know once I start to grow as a developer I will evolve this project as I go on.
